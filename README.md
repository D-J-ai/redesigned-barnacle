# redesigned-barnacle
This repo will host some finely tuned generative language AI models and a single vision focused AI model. 
The two generative language AIs, structured on Google DeepMinds Gemini-1.0-Pro, are finalizing their tuning and will be uploaded, with documentation, within the week. 
The PIÈCE DE RÉSISTANCE of D.J.ai will be the vision focused image generation and editing (amoung other image-esque features) model. It is currenly still in it's early img.dat training days. It is structured from Google DeepMinds Imagen2 API. It is code-named Project Tarot. I'm excited for this one. 
Stay tuned for more information and updates on its expected release.
